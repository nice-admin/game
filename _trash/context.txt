I'm making a lightweight python game in which you manage teams of 3D artists to create a project.
It's mostly about selecting entities like computers, monitor screens, artists and project managers and yuu place them on a game grid composed of square fields.
Each placed entity has some properties, for example timer which periodically checks whether the entitiy's satisfaction is met and so on.
The goal is to make projects a do it efficiently, this means putting good teams together composed of various entities, satisfy them and let them perform.
